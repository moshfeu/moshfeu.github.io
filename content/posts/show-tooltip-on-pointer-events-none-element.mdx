I'm a big fan of "css only" approaches ([For example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33931219/863110)) and I'm sure I'm not alone. That's why I was so exsiting to get to know the [`pointer-events`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) property.
With `prevent-default` we can "disable" non input elements such as links (even though it might not considered a good accessiblity approach)
Before it came to our life we had to use code to stop the event when link is "disabled"

``` js
document.querySelector('a').addEventListener('click', e => {
  if (e.target.classList.contains('disabled')) {
    e.preventDefault();
  }
});
```

What about if this `a` is added by code (React for example)? pretty much nightmare.

But with css

``` css
a.disabled {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

Magic!

### Powerfull, right? Too powerful

Let's go back to our example - a "disabled" link. Usually when an element disabled, we want to show a tooltip to explain why.
To simplify the example, I'm using the `title` property so the browser will show a native tooltip. (Once again, it's probably not accessibility compliance, but it demonstrates a use case).

Here is the code
<iframe height="148" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="ExNwKja" src="https://codepen.io/moshfeu/embed/preview/ExNwKja?height=148&amp;theme-id=light&amp;default-tab=html,result" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/moshfeu/pen/ExNwKja' data-tomark-pass data-tomark-pass data-tomark-pass data-tomark-pass >ExNwKja</a> by Mosh

Now try to hover the link to get the tooltip displayed. Nothing happening, right?
The thing is, `pointer-events: none` behaviour is that

> The element is never the target of pointer events

"Never" means not only "click" events but also "hover". So when element has `pointer-events: none` the browser doesn't apply the hover state therefor, the tooltip doesn't show.

### The trick

I didn't write all of the Gibrish above just to give a sad ending. The trick is simple, to add the `pointer-events: none` only on `:active` state. This trick lavarages the browser behaviour so first it's applying `:active` styles and then invoking the handlers (browser and site code).
