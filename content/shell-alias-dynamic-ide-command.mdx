## The Problem

When using multiple IDEs (like VS Code and Cursor), shell aliases that open files in an editor can become inconvenient. An alias that runs `code` will always open VS Code, even when working in a terminal launched from Cursor.

## The Solution

We can create a dynamic alias that detects which IDE launched the terminal by checking the parent process, then opens files in the correct editor.

For a specific file, the alias looks like this:

```bash
alias edit-alias='[[ "$(ps -o comm= -p $PPID)" == *"Cursor"* ]] && cursor ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/alias.zsh || code ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/alias.zsh'
```

The `ps -o comm= -p $PPID` command checks the terminal's parent process name. If it contains "Cursor", it uses the `cursor` command, otherwise it defaults to `code`.

## A More Flexible Approach

Instead of hard-coding file paths in each alias, we can create a reusable function:

```bash
edit() {
  if [[ "$(ps -o comm= -p $PPID)" == *"Cursor"* ]]; then
    cursor "$1"
  else
    code "$1"
  fi
}

alias edit-alias='edit ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/alias.zsh'
```

Now the `edit` function can be used directly in the terminal with any file path:

```bash
edit path/to/your/file
```
